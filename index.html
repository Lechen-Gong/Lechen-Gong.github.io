    <h2>The Unexpected Resilience of Nintendo Switch in the Face of PlayStation 5's Launch</h2>
    <p>
      With the strong demand for the Nintendo Switch 2 after its April 24th launch, a key question arises: 
      How did the original Switch fare against the PS5 release in November 2020?
    </p>
    <p>
      We explored this through event study analysis, game release patterns, and sentiment analysis to assess
      whether the PS5's launch significantly impacted Switch sales—revealing unexpected insights into market dynamics
      and consumer behavior.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="competitors">
    <h2>The Competitors: Nintendo vs. Sony</h2>
    <p>
      Nintendo, a veteran in the video game market since the 1980s, launched the Switch in 2017, which has sold
      over 150 million units globally. Sony, which entered the market with PlayStation 1 in the 1990s,
      launched the PS5 in November 2020, achieving over 75 million units sold to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Xbox Series also exists in this gaming console market, our analysis focused on Switch and PS5
      as the primary competitors based on the current market share data from VGChartz.
    </p>

  <section class="discovery">
    <h2>A Surprising Discovery: PS5 Had No Significant Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Our event study analysis revealed something unexpected:
      <strong>the PS5 launch had no significant effect on Nintendo Switch sales</strong>.
      While sales appeared to spike after the PS5 release when viewed casually, deeper analysis
      (Interrupted Time Series and Regression) showed this was actually the normal December holiday 
      sales peak that Switch experiences every year, regardless of competition.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      <strong>After removing the effect of seasonality and conducting placebo tests,</strong> 
      we confirmed that the PS5 launch didn't significantly alter the Switch's sales trajectory.
      This ran counter to the common assumption that a major competitor's launch would eat into Nintendo's
      market share.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      The insight here is powerful: the console market may be less of a zero‑sum game than commonly believed.
      Consumers do not necessarily choose PS5 or Switch -- the platforms appear to serve different market 
      segments with limited direct competition.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we do observe that Switch sales dipped in November 2020 compared to the same month in previous years.
      If not the PS5, what else could explain this short‑term decline?
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      This raised a new question for us: If not the PS5, what else could explain this short-term decline?
      Given that software availability and quality are often the main drivers of console sales, 
      we then decided to investigate further by examining the games released for the Nintendo Switch during this period.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section class="content-drought">
    <h2>A Content Drought: Fewer NS Game Releases After PS5 Launch</h2>
    <p>
      We focused on the 6-month window before and after the PS5’s release again, 
      during which 1,204 games were launched across all platforms. To reduce noise and capture meaningful trends, 
      we narrowed it to the Top 50 most-reviewed titles—since many publishers don’t share sales data, reviews serve as 
      a strong proxy for popularity and engagement. Of these 50, only 17 were available on the Nintendo Switch, 
      helping us examine how major releases may have influenced console sales.
    </p>

    <p>Here’s what stood out:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>of those 17 titles launched before the PS5 release.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>8 of them were Nintendo first-party exclusives</strong>  — games developed or published by Nintendo and only available on the Switch.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>However, after the PS5 launch, only one</strong> new top‑50 game appeared on Switch — and it wasn’t exclusive.
      This sharp decline in major releases likely contributed to the dip in console sales.
      Without fresh, compelling titles, sustaining consumer interest becomes challenging.
    </p>

    <p>This leads to our next question: Did player sentiment toward Switch games shift during this dry spell?</p>

    <p>To find out, we conducted a sentiment analysis of player reviews.</p>

  </section>

  <section class="core-fans">
    <h2>Core Fans to the Rescue: The Sentiment Paradox</h2>
    <p>
      Our analysis of thousands of game reviews uncovered something surprisingly counterintuitive: 
      while Nintendo Switch sales experienced a temporary dip after the PS5 launch, 
      <strong>player sentiment Switch games actually improved.</strong> 
    </p>

    <figure>
    <img

      alt="Monthly AFINN Sentiment Around PS5 Launch"
      class="featured-image"

    </figure>

    <p>
      At first glance, this didn’t quite add up. How could fewer new releases and lower sales coincide with happier players? 
      To answer that, we had to look beyond the numbers—and focus on who was writing the reviews:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before PS5:</strong> A flood of releases meant reviews came from both casual and core gamers, with varying levels of enthusiasm.</li>
      <li><strong>After PS5:</strong> With fewer releases, reviews came primarily from dedicated enthusiasts—players deeply invested in the Nintendo ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This sampling shift explains why sentiment rose despite fewer releases. 
      The audience narrowed from the general player base to hardcore fans who tend to express stronger positive opinions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="loyalty">
    <h2>The Language of Loyalty: What Core Fans Said</h2>

    <p>
      Looking at the actual language in reviews revealed fascinating insights about Nintendo's most dedicated players:
    </p>

    <figure>
    <img
      src="/_images/6.jpg"
      alt="Waterfall of Sentiment Drivers (Switch Only)"
      class="featured-image"
    >
    <figcaption>Waterfall of Sentiment Drivers (Switch Only)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Emotional Superlatives:</strong>Core fans heavily favored terms like “outstanding,” “awesome,” and “fantastic”—using intensely positive language to describe their gaming experiences.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Connection:</strong>Terms like “love,” “happy,” and “beautiful” appeared frequently, showing that these players form emotional bonds with their games rather than just evaluating them clinically.</li>
      <li><strong>Conversational Tone:</strong>Core fans avoided formal critic terminology like "masterpiece" in favor of more conversational expressions of excitement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This linguistic signature of Nintendo’s loyal fan base represents a valuable asset—a community primed to generate word-of-mouth marketing.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section class="niches">
    <h2>The Power of Niches: Not All Games Are Created Equal</h2>

    <p>
      When we examined which game types generated the strongest positive reactions, a clear pattern emerged.
      While blockbuster titles dominated in review volume, niche genres inspired much stronger enthusiasm:
    </p>

    <figure>
    <img

      alt="Top 10 Switch Genres by Sentiment Increase (Excluding Head Games)"
      class="featured-image"
    >
    <figcaption>Top 10 Switch Genres by Sentiment Increase (Excluding Head Games)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Metroidvania titles</strong> saw the largest sentiment boost, with players expressing particular passion for games like Ori and the Will of the Wisps and Hollow Knight</li>
      <li><strong>Virtual Life games</strong> like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley generated deeply personal connections and loyalty</li>
      <li><strong>Action‑Adventure/RPGs</strong> titles maintained strong followings even during the release lull</li>
    </ul>

    <p> 
      Meanwhile, mass-market categories like FPS and sports games generated more reviews but more moderate sentiment. 
      The top three games by review volume (“head” games) consistently showed lower sentiment scores than the "long tail" of smaller titles.
    </p>

    <p>
      This reveals a crucial dynamic in platform ecosystems: blockbuster titles may drive initial sales, 
      but niche categories create the deep emotional connections that sustain a platform through content gaps.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="rebound">
    <h2>The Inevitable Rebound: Why Nintendo's Dip Was Temporary</h2>

    <p>
      Our holistic analysis points to a clear conclusion: Nintendo Switch’s temporary sales dip 
      stemmed from a content gap rather than PS5 competition. The formula for its inevitable rebound looks like this:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Content Cycle, Not Competition:</strong> The dip reflected Nintendo's release schedule, not PlayStation’s competitive pressure</li>
      <li><strong>Core Fan Foundation:</strong> Dedicated enthusiasts maintained high sentiment during the content gap</li>
      <li><strong>Word‑of‑Mouth Momentum:</strong> The emotionally charged language in reviews suggests strong organic buzz continued</li>
      <li><strong>Release Pipeline:</strong> As new Switch exclusives return, they build on this foundation of enthusiast support</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In other words, Nintendo's loyal community provides a buffer against competitive threats, 
      creating resilience in the platform's ecosystem even during release lulls.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion: The Platform Paradox</h2>
    <p>
      The Nintendo Switch highlights a key paradox in platform businesses: 
      what seems like a battle between ecosystems is often driven by internal platform dynamics.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the media focused on PS5 vs. Switch, the real story lay within Nintendo’s ecosystem—balancing blockbuster 
      and niche titles, timing first-party releases, and engaging passionate game communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      For platform businesses, long-term success comes from cultivating a strong ecosystem, not just outpacing rivals.
